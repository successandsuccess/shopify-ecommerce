            "row_content": "<p>To keep it simple, professional dress for men can be looked at in four different ways. The four types of professional dress include: Business formal Business professional Business casual (most popular) Casual. If you’re unsure about your workplace dress code, it never hurts to ask your hiring manager. Dress code should be disclosed upon hire. If it still seems unclear, ask around. See what others in your role are wearing. Unsure what to wear on day one? It may be safe to dress more business professional and assess on day one. Business casual is a growing style that allows you to look clean cut while wearing rather casual clothing. This style can include joggers, sporty jackets, untucked shirts, performance pants, and more. For example, you could wear performance pants with an unbuttoned and untucked shirt. Performance pants allow you to look professional while feeling comfortable, almost like you’re at home in your pajamas. Better yet, performance pants and shirts should not wrinkle like traditional dress pants and shirts.</p>"

In general, business attire is whatever is deemed appropriate in your place of work. It may also depend on the nature of the day. For example, if you are meeting potential new clients you may choose to wear something more formal than your day to day attire. While you may wear nice pants and a collared shirt on a typical day, a day of interviews may entail dressing more formally. Since dress codes can vary it’s important to have a wardrobe that allows you to mix and match styles.</p>"

For some men, business attire looks like nice pants with a buttoned down shirt and tie. For some, it may look like pants with a blazer or sports jacket. In some work settings, business casual attire for a man may even be just a clean polo with pants. In today’s world we are seeing more casual business settings. Even top executives are strolling into work wearing athleisure clothing items such as performance pants and tennis shoes as opposed to slacks and dress shoes. The key is finding clothes that make you feel confident while projecting a professional, clean-cut vibe.</p><p></p>"

            "row_content": "<p>Professional business casual attire for men is trending. The days of restrictive slacks and stiff dress shoes are becoming a thing of the past. In replacement, we are seeing performance pants and tennis shoes on the rise. A professional casual style reflects that you’re professional, yet a real human too. Clients and colleagues will not look at you and think “they are underdressed” but rather “they look comfortable and professional.” We’ve all been approached by the salesman that makes us cringe because he’s overdressed and covered in cologne. It’s a turn off, really. Most of us would rather deal with someone we can relate to. What we wear can give off a first impression, so it’s important to make the right impact. So what’s acceptable for professional casual wear for men? Professional casual for men means a little more comfort while maintaining a professional look. Some may opt in for more comfortable fabrics and refrain from the button ups and ties. Some typical items men wear for professional casual include golf polos, collared shirts, untucked shirts, jeans, and sweaters.</p>"

It’s simply just a more relaxed business feel. Regardless of business formal or business casual, your clothing should be comfortable, clean pressed, and functional. Business casual attire for men may include some more comfortable fitting pants and a collared shirt with no tie.</p>"
